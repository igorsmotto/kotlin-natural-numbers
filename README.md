# Kotlin Natural Numbers

 A playground for implementing the natural numbers in number theory
 
 A natural number can be defined as a recursive structure as either zero or a successor of zero

 ```i.e.: 5 = Succ(Succ(Succ(Succ(Succ(Zero)))))```

Caveats:
- "5 - 6" can result in either 0 or an error, I opted for the former
- "3 / 2" should return the natural division (1)
- Division by 0 can result in either infinity or error, I opted for the latter
